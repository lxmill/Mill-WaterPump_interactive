# Mill-WaterPump_interactive

This interactive project utilizes capacitive sensors for user engagement. Placing a hand on the sensors triggers distinct actions: the left hand activates the mill, while the right hand activates a water pump for spraying. While idle, the windmill displays a spectrum of colors, but it glows white on left-hand interaction and blue on right-hand interaction.
